                    E-waste (electronic products that have reached the end of their “useful life”) contains many harmful chemicals. If these products end up in landfill, these toxins can leak into the soil and have devastating impacts on the local environment. We need to change our habits by treating e-waste recycling as the next step in an electronic product’s lifecycle. Help us protect the environment and educate your family, friends and neighbours about the importance of keeping e-waste out of landfill!
